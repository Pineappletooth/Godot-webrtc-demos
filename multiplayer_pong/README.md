# Pong Multiplayer

A multiplayer demo of Pong. One player presses "host".
The other presses "join". This only works locally.

Language: GDScript

Renderer: GLES 2

Note: The non-multiplayer version is available [here](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-demo-projects/tree/master/2d/pong).

Check out this demo on the asset library: https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/138
